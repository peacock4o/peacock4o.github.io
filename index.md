# About

Heyo. I'm an incoming first-year PhD student in the [Dynamic Decision Making (DDM)](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/ddmlab/) lab at Carnegie Mellon, advised by the wonderful [Cleotilde Gonzalez](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/ddmlab/cotyweb/).

I help organize CTFs, [defense competitions](https://www.nationalccdc.org/), [cybersecurity clubs](https://uwctf.cs.washington.edu/), and [conferences](https://www.bsidesseattle.com/).

I was an [RSA Security Scholar](https://www.rsaconference.com/rsac-programs/security-scholar) in 2024. I also founded the [Gray Hats Cybersecurity Club](https://faculty.washington.edu/lagesse/grayhats.html) at UW Bothell.

Also generally interested in cryptography, usable PETs, and psychology.
