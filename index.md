# About

Heyo. I'm a first-year PhD student in [CyLab](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/) and [Dynamic Decision Making (DDMLab)](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/ddmlab/) at Carnegie Mellon, coadvised by [Vyas Sekar](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~vsekar/) and [Cleotilde Gonzalez](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/ddmlab/cotyweb/).

I help organize CTFs, [defense competitions](https://www.nationalccdc.org/), [cybersecurity clubs](https://uwctf.cs.washington.edu/), and [conferences](https://www.bsidesseattle.com/).

I was an [RSA Security Scholar](https://www.rsaconference.com/rsac-programs/security-scholar) in 2024. I also founded the [Gray Hats Cybersecurity Club](https://faculty.washington.edu/lagesse/grayhats.html) at UW Bothell.


# Academic Interests

Autonomous cyber attack/defense systems, multiagent systems, reinforcement learning, and computational cognition. 

Also generally interested in networking and psychology.
